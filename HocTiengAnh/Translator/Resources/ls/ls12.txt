Lesson 12: DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY?

Laura, what are you going to do today?

I'm going shopping.

What time are you leaving?

I'm going to leave around 4 o'clock.

Will you buy a ham sandwich for me at the store?

OK.

Do you have enough money?

I'm not sure.

How much do you have?

25 dollars. Do you think that's enough?

That's not very much.

I think it's OK. I also have two credit cards.

Let me give you another ten dollars.

Thanks. See you later.

Bye.

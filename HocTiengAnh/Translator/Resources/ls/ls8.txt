Lesson 8: CHOOSING A TIME TO MEET

Jennifer, would you like to have dinner with me? Yes. That would be nice. When do you want to go? Is today OK?
Sorry, I can't go today.

How about tomorrow night?

Ok. What time?

Is 9:00PM all right? I think that's too late. Is 6:00PM OK?
Yes, that's good. Where would you like to go?

The Italian restaurant on 5th street.

Oh, I don't like that Restaurant. I don't want to go there.

How about the Korean restaurant next to it?

OK, I like that place.

Lesson 7: THATâ€™S TOO LATE!

Mary, would you like to get something to eat with me?

OK. When?

At 10 O'clock.

10 in the morning?

No, at night.

Sorry, that's too late. I usually go to bed around 10:00PM.

OK, how about 1:30 PM?

No, that's too early. I'll still be at work then.

How about 5:00PM?

That's fine.

OK, see you then.

Alright. Bye.

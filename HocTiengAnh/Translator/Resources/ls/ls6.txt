Lesson 6: DO YOU WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK?

David, would you like something to eat?

No, I'm full.

Do you want something to drink?

Yes, I'd like some coffee.

Sorry, I don't have any coffee. That's OK. I'll have a glass of water. A small glass, or a big one?
Small please. Here you go. Thanks.
You're welcome.
